## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Hello, here you can see the personal landing page of user @raferdev. I overengineered some aspects to build content that used a little of all, and I would like to see in the past to understand better the web functionality, like server, http config, tests, and the frontend aspects themselves. I think seeing something end-to-end can clarify how thoughts connect and how they can be more complex with time, features, and security aspects. See this as an example.
